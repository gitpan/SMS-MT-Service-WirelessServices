SMS::MT::Service::WirelessServices
==================================

Description
-----------

This package contains a class for creating a standalone object or an object
that acts as a plugin for a SMS::MT receptor object. See the SMS::MT
documentation for details. This class sends mobile terminated SMS's via the
interfaces of http://www.wireless-services.nl.
I've included a HTML version of the POD docs in the docs subdirectory.
I've included the specs I used in the specs subdirectory.

Installation
------------

Note: I added the line "require 5.6.0;" to Makefile.PL because I've only
tested this module on this version of Perl. You may remove the line if you want
to try this module on an earlier version of Perl.

 perl Makefile.PL
 make
 make install
 perldoc SMS::MT::Service::WirelessServices

If you already have a userid and password for this service and an open
internet connection you may try the next line to send some SMS's. Press
ctrl-c when you're tired of sending them.

 make test
